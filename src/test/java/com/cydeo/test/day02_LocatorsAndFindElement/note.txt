- To be able to any action of any web element , there are centain steps we have to follow.

* we have to locate the web element we want to work on.
* to locate we have to use a set of methods coming from selenium lib.
 - find element
 - locator methods
* we decide waht action we want to apply, find the method and use it on the already located web element.
- click

findElement(LOCATOR) method:
- this methods finds and returns SINGLE web element.
- it accepts a locator argument, and finds the request web element using locator.
- return type : web element type (comes from selenium library)
- It will throw "NoSuchElementException" ------  - - - - -- - - - - --  -- - - -
Bu hatayı vermenin iki nedeni var. There are 2 reasons it gives that error.
 - 1# if you provide a wrong locator
 - 2# if your page does not load as fast as it should

- this locator will only works on links. <a> tags only

   - partialLinkText

2#name

- it uses "name" attirubutes value to locate web element
